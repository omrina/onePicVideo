mp3 + image => mp4

You can also convert multiple mp3 files to mp4 with the same image at once!

# Usage
To make the magic work, first you need to install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`, like this:

Open a terminal (cmd) and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Look through the `src/configs.py` file, and make sure it's suitable for you.

Then run `main.py` and that's it!

Be patient as the mp4 creation make take some time.
