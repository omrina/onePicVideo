# onePicVideo
mp3 + image => mp4

You can convert multiple mp3 files to mp4 with the same image at once!
You can also use a different image for each mp3 file.

# Usage
To make the magic work, first you need to install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`, like this:

Open a terminal (cmd) and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
And make sure you have python installed.

Look through the `src/configs.py` file, and make sure it's suitable for you.

Create a mp3 files folder and an images folder (according to `configs.py`) and put your desired files there.

Then run `main.py` and that's it!

Be patient as the mp4 creation make take some time.


# Imporant Notes
Sometimes a video won't work (neither the audio or the image). To resolve this try an image greater than 500x500.
